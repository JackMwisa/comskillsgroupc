                        <p>Communication is the process of sending and receiving messages through verbal or nonverbal means, including speech, or oral communication; writing and graphical representations (such as infographics, maps, and charts); and signs, signals, and behavior. More simply, communication is said to be "the creation and exchange of meaning".

                            Media critic and theorist James Carey defined communication as "a symbolic process whereby reality is produced, maintained, repaired and transformed" in his 1992 book "Communication as Culture," positing that we define our reality via sharing our experience with others.

                        <p><code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are two relatively new types of variable
                            declarations in
                            JavaScript. As we mentioned
                            earlier, <code>let</code> is similar to <code>var</code> in some respects, but allows users
                            to
                            avoid some of the common “gotchas”
                            that users run into in JavaScript. <code>const</code> is an augmentation of <code>let</code>
                            in
                            that it prevents re-assignment to
                            a variable.

                            With TypeScript being a superset of JavaScript, the language naturally supports <code>let</code>
                            and <code>const</code>. Here
                            we’ll elaborate more on these new declarations and why they’re preferable to <code>var</code>.

                            If you’ve used JavaScript offhandedly, the next section might be a good way to refresh your
                            memory.
                            If
                            you’re intimately familiar with all the quirks of <code>var</code> declarations in
                            JavaScript, you
                            might find it
                            easier to skip ahead. </p>

                        <h3>var Declarations</h3>
                        <p>Declaring a variable in JavaScript has always traditionally been done with the <code>var</code>
                            keyword.</p>

                        <code class="code-box">var a = 10;</code>
                        <p>As you might’ve figured out, we just declared a variable named a with the value 10.</p>

                        <p>We can also declare a variable inside of a function:</p>

                        <code class="code-box">function f() { <br>
                        var message = "Hello, world!"; <br>
                            <br>
                        return message; <br>
                        }</code>
                        <p>and we can also access those same variables within other functions:</p>

                        <code class="code-box">function f() { <br>
                        var a = 10; <br>
                        return function g() { <br>
                        var b = a + 1; <br>
                        return b; <br>
                        } <br>
                        } <br>
                        <br>
                        var g = f(); <br>
                        g(); // returns '11'</code>
                        <br>

                        <h3><code>let</code> declarations</h3>
                        <p>By now you’ve figured out that <code>var</code> has some problems, which is precisely why
                            <code>let</code>
                            statements were
                            introduced. Apart from the keyword used, <code>let</code> statements are written the same
                            way <code>var</code>
                            statements are.</p>

                        <code class="code-box">let hello = "Hello!";</code>
                        <p>The key difference is not in the syntax, but in the semantics, which we’ll now dive into.</p>

                        <p>When a variable is declared using let, it uses what some call lexical-scoping or
                            block-scoping.
                            Unlike
                            variables declared with var whose scopes leak out to their containing function,
                            block-scoped
                            variables
                            are not visible outside of their nearest containing block or for-loop.</p>

                        <code class="code-box">function f(input: boolean) { <br>
                        let a = 100; <br>
                            <br>
                        if (input) { <br>
                        // Still okay to reference 'a' <br>
                        let b = a + 1; <br>
                        return b; <br>
                        } <br>
                        <br>
                        // Error: 'b' doesn't exist here <br>
                        return b; <br>
                        }</code>
                        <p>Here, we have two local variables a and b. a’s scope is limited to the body of f while b’s
                            scope is
                            limited to the containing if statement’s block.</p>

                        <p>Variables declared in a catch clause also have similar scoping rules.</p>

                        <code class="code-box">try { <br>
                        throw "oh no!"; <br>
                        } <br>
                        catch (e) { <br>
                        console.log("Oh well."); <br>
                        } <br>
                        <br>
                        // Error: 'e' doesn't exist here <br>
                        console.log(e);</code>
                        <br>

                        <h3>const declarations</h3>
                        <p>const declarations are another way of declaring variables.</p>

                        <code class="code-box">const numLivesForCat = 9;</code>

                        <p>They are like let declarations but, as their name implies, their value cannot be changed
                            once they are
                            bound. In other words, they have the same scoping rules as let, but you can’t re-assign to
                            them.</p>

                        <p>This should not be confused with the idea that the values they refer to are immutable.</p>

                        <code class="code-box">const numLivesForCat = 9; <br>
                        const kitty = { <br>
                        name: "Aurora", <br>
                        numLives: numLivesForCat, <br>
                        } <br>
                        <br>
                        // Error <br>
                        kitty = { <br>
                        name: "Danielle", <br>
                        numLives: numLivesForCat <br>
                        }; <br>
                        <br>
                        // all "okay" <br>
                        kitty.name = "Rory"; <br>
                        kitty.name = "Kitty"; <br>
                        kitty.name = "Cat"; <br>
                        kitty.numLives--;</code>

                        <p>Unless you take specific measures to avoid it, the internal state of a <code>const</code>
                            variable is still
                            modifiable. Fortunately, TypeScript allows you to specify that members of an object are
                            readonly. The
                            chapter on Interfaces has the details.</p>

                        <h3>let vs. const</h3>
                        <p>Given that we have two types of declarations with similar scoping semantics, it’s natural to
                            find
                            ourselves asking which one to use. Like most broad questions, the answer is: it depends.</p>

                        <p>Applying the principle of least privilege, all declarations other than those you plan to
                            modify should
                            use const. The rationale is that if a variable didn’t need to get written to, others
                            working on the
                            same codebase shouldn’t automatically be able to write to the object, and will need to
                            consider whether
                            they really need to reassign to the variable. Using const also makes code more predictable
                            when
                            reasoning about flow of data.</p>

                        <p>Use your best judgement, and if applicable, consult the matter with the rest of your team.</p>

                        <p>The majority of this handbook uses <code>let</code> declarations.</p>

                        <p>Traditional JavaScript uses functions and prototype-based inheritance to build up reusable
                            components, but this may feel a bit awkward to programmers more comfortable with an
                            object-oriented approach, where classes inherit functionality and objects are built from
                            these
                            classes. Starting with ECMAScript 2015, also known as ECMAScript 6, JavaScript programmers
                            will
                            be able to build their applications using this object-oriented class-based approach. In
                            TypeScript, we allow developers to use these techniques now, and compile them down to
                            JavaScript that works across all major browsers and platforms, without having to wait for
                            the
                            next version of JavaScript.</p>

                        <p>Let’s take a look at a simple class-based example:</p>

                        <code class="code-box">class Greeter { <br>
                                greeting: string; <br>
                                constructor(message: string) { <br>
                                this.greeting = message; <br>
                                } <br>
                                greet() { <br>
                                return "Hello, " + this.greeting; <br>
                                } <br>
                                } <br>
        <br>
                                let greeter = new Greeter("world"); <br></code>
                        <br>
                        <p>The syntax should look familiar if you’ve used C# or Java before. We declare a new class
                            Greeter. This class has three members: a property called <code>greeting</code>, a <code>constructor</code>,
                            and a method
                            greet.</p>

                        <p>You’ll notice that in the class when we refer to one of the members of the class we prepend
                            this.. This denotes that it’s a member access.</p>

                        <p>In the last line we construct an instance of the Greeter class using new. This calls into
                            the
                            constructor we defined earlier, creating a new object with the Greeter shape, and running
                            the
                            constructor to initialize it.</p>

                        <h3>Inheritance</h3>
                        <p>In TypeScript, we can use common object-oriented patterns. One of the most fundamental
                            patterns
                            in class-based programming is being able to extend existing classes to create new ones
                            using
                            inheritance.</p>

                        <p>Let’s take a look at an example:</p>

                        <code class="code-box">class Animal {<br>
                                move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {<br>
                                console.log(`Animal moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);<br>
                                }<br>
                                }<br>
        <br>
                                class Dog extends Animal {<br>
                                bark() {<br>
                                console.log('Woof! Woof!');<br>
                                }<br>
                                }<br>
        
                                const dog = new Dog();<br>
                                dog.bark();<br>
                                dog.move(10);<br>
                                dog.bark();</code>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>This example shows the most basic inheritance feature: classes inherit properties and
                            methods
                            from base classes. Here, Dog is a derived class that derives from the Animal base class
                            using
                            the extends keyword. Derived classes are often called subclasses, and base classes are
                            often
                            called superclasses.</p>

                        <p>Because Dog extends the functionality from Animal, we were able to create an instance of Dog
                            that could both <code>bark()</code> and <code>move()</code>.</p>

                        <p>To begin, just as in JavaScript, TypeScript functions can be created both as a named
                            function
                            or as an anonymous function. This allows you to choose the most appropriate approach for
                            your
                            application, whether you’re building a list of functions in an API or a one-off function to
                            hand off to another function.</p>

                        <p>To quickly recap what these two approaches look like in JavaScript:</p>

                        <code class="code-box">  // Named function
                                function add(x, y) {<br>
                                return x + y;<br>
                                }<br>
        <br>
                                // Anonymous function<br>
                                let myAdd = function(x, y) { return x + y; };<br>
                              </code>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Just as in JavaScript, functions can refer to variables outside of the function body. When
                            they
                            do so, they’re said to capture these variables. While understanding how this works, and the
                            trade-offs when using this technique, are outside of the scope of this article, having a
                            firm
                            understanding how this mechanic is an important piece of working with JavaScript and
                            TypeScript.</p>

                        <code class="code-box">let z = 100;<br>
        <br>
                                function addToZ(x, y) {<br>
                                return x + y + z;<br>
                                }<br></code><br>
