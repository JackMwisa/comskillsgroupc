                        <p>An audience a group of people who have gathered to listen to or witness a public event such as a play, speech, or concert. To define audience in literature, it is who the author writes their piece for in other words, the reader. These sometimes can be called ( spectators, listeners, viewers, concertgoers).</p>

                    <h3>What is audience analysis?</h3>
                    <p>Audience analysis is the method of obtaining information about the people in your audience to better understand their wants, needs, values, and attitudes. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Demographic audience analysis</li>
                        <li>Psychographic audience analysis</li>
                        <li>Situational audience analysis</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Demographic audience analysis</h3>
                    <p>This is the type of audience analysis which include things like gender, age range, marital status, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. You probably already know how many male and female students are in your public speaking class, how old they are roughly, and so on.</p>
                    <p>But how can you figure out who will be in an audience if you have never talked to them? Most of the time, you can ask the person or group that asked you to speak. They can probably tell you a lot about the types of people who are expected to come to hear you.</p>
                    <p>No matter what method you use to collect demographic information, be respectful from the start. For example, if you want to know if people in the audience have ever been divorced, you should know that not everyone will want to answer your questions. You can’t demand that they do it. And you can’t just guess why they don’t want to talk about it. You have to give them some space.</p>
                
                    <h4>Psychographic audience analysis</h4>
                    <p>This is the type of audience analysis where information is not that easy to understand. A psychographic analysis looks at things like values, beliefs, opinions, and attitudes. Even though two people say they don’t buy junk food, they might have very different ideas about what foods are “junk food.”</p>

                    <p>There may be misconceptions or stereotypes about your topic that people already know. When you do your audience analysis, include questions that show how much your audience already knows about your case. Try to find out if they have any stereotypes, oversimplified ideas, or biased beliefs about it. This could change the message you want to send and how you want to send it.</p>
                
                
                    <h3>Situational audience analysis</h3>
                    <p>This is the type of audience analysis which include the audience’s size, attitude toward the speaker, prior knowledge of the topic, and occasion.</p>    
                
                    <p>In the world of digital marketing and media, this refers to the size of your preferred audience, their attitude towards your product/company, their prior knowledge, and the websites or social media channels. They view your advertisements or interact with your products and services by this.</p>
                    <p>It is more challenging to collect this information when your audience is geographically dispersed because you are not addressing the audience directly at this time. But, similar to a world leader delivering a speech, it is essential to learn how to engage potential customers online, especially in a world of limitless options and audience information (Ruth, 2021)</p>
                
                    <p><strong>In conclusion, the following concepts of audience analysis of Demographic audience analysis
                        Psychographic audience analysis and Situational audience analysis are the best types audience analysis which any presenter must to do in order to come up with the best presentation
